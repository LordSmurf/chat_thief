Revolutionary Commands

!peace
!revolution
!coup
!la_libre

You vote for either !peace or !revolution

You can swap from peace to revolution anytime

!la_libre
shows the total votes
and the instability of the goverment

If there are enough votes required for the a coup,
and the person triggering the coup can afford the Cool Point
Cost, then which ever side has more votes wins

Revolution Wins

All of the commands are redistributed to the Revolutionaries evenly
All Peace Keepers and Fence Sitters lose all their Sounds and go Bankrupt

Peace Wins

All the commands of the revolutionaries are redistributed to the Peace Keepers
Fence Sitters lose all sounds, but not money!
