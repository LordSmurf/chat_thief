# How Does The Coup System Work

## WORK IN PROGRESS

Viewers can vote for either !peace or !revolution.

You can vote as many times as you want, but only your las tvote counts

Once the threshold of votes has been met, you are ALLOWED to trigger a Coup.
The Threshold is determined by the number of active chatting users.

Coups cost Cool Points

## 2 Ways Of Triggering A Coup

### Revolutionary Coup

-> Revolution can be triggered, if the total of Cool Points of the
revolutionaries is enough for a Coup. When the coup is triggered,
then the cost of Cool Points divided by the revolutionaries will
subtracted from each Revolutionary.

All Owned Sounds will be confiscated and evenly redistributed to the
revolutionaries.

### Peace Coup

-> To Trigger a Peace coup. You have to be able to afford the entire Coup
yourself.

Once a Coup is triggered. All of the Revolutionary sounds will be confiscated
and evenly distrusted among the Peace Keepers

Maybe: (Except everyone gets to keep one).
