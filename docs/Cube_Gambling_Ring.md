However many you bet, that many you can win
if you bet and lose, ya lose
if someone gets right on the money, they win all sounds people bet

!bet 45 (implies choosing random sound)
!bet 45 clap
!bet 45 clap damn
!bet 26s 5
!bet 26 5

What about Cost of the commands:
   if you win, then total value of commands bet,
   will be won from other sounds bet

- You win more sounds, if you are closer
- You either are the closest (with ties)
- Or you're right on the Bet
- If you get the exact bet
- get all sounds

awfulwaffl3: so here's question: whats driving me to bet more than 1 sound
because if I get it on the money i'm getting all the sounds

User 1: bet !damn | Cost 1

User 2: bet !clap and !hello Cost 2 each

User 3: bet !cool_stuff Cost 5 and !other Cost 1

---

User 1 Win !other

User 2 wins: !damn, !other, the fed would supply

User 3 Wins: Win all the commands, and a fed command

Debate: What happens if you guess exactly?

- give all sounds that were bet
- nothing
- based on how much you bet, you get a bonus
- Number of sounds * number of bets / 4 -> The Fed will drop those sounds
