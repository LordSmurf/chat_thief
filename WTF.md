2 Types of Currency:

## Street Cred / Good Boi Points

- You earn it from working (chatting)
- You can only give it to other

## Cool Points / Tendies

- When someone gives you Street Cred, it becomes Cool Points
- Cool Points are NOT transferable
- Cool Points can be spent (to buy sounds)

## The Goverment

- We will not provide services to trade commands
  if you need that, then the market should supply it

## FAQ

Q: How do you get street cred?
A: Chatting

## Hand of the Market

There are 300+ soundeffects on my computer that have been added by myself, but
mostly viewers.

Each command is accessible through a simple !<NAME_OF_COMMAND>

However, We do not tell you what the commands are, you can guess, suggest you
own, or trying and pick up clues from others.

Also you do not have access to any commands by default, except !clap.
This can be used to test that you can trigger soundeffects.

Permissions for soundeffects work like this:

There are Stream Lords who have access to every sound.
They also have the power to add sounds, including your requests!

A Stream Lord can give you access to an individual sound.
Also any viewer who has access to a sound can give someone else access to that
sound!

There are also random drops, when a random user is given a random sound, maybe
it will be you!

Finally you can submit a theme song, and this is a sound that only you will have
access to. It will also play everytime you join the chat for the first time each
stream! The theme should be no more than 5 seconds from a youtube clip in the
following format:

`!soundeffect YOUTUBE_ID YOUR_FULL_TWITCHNAME_LOWERCASE 00:05 00:09`

Once a Streamlord approves this, you and you alone will have access to your
theme song.
