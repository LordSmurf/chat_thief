```

Example Output:

@cooluser420 - Street Cred: 0 | Cool Points: 0
```

## How Do You Gain Power

Make friends in the chat, and someone can give you cool Cool Points
Note: You can only get Cool Points from other Users

Hope to win one of the regular drops that gives a soundeffect to a random user
in the chat.

## Street Cred Commands

You can give someone in the chat your street cred. Or you can give some or all
of it to a random user. props, endorse, bigups all do the same thing.

Examples:

```bash
!endorse @artmattdank
!bigups artmattdank
!props artmattdank 5
!props random 7
!props
!endorse
!bigups
```

## Cool Points Commands

Once someone gives their street cred to someone else, it is transformed into
Cool Points. If you want Cool Points, you need someone in the chat to give them
to you!

Examples:

```bash
!buy !clap
!buy damn
!buy random

!steal clap beginbotbot

!share !clap @artmattdank
```

There are 500+ Soundeffects (and always climbing thanks to submissions from
viewers like yourself), which you can gain access to. However, we do not publize
the full list of soundeffects, you can always buy random, to get a random one,
or learn what soundeffects you want from participating in the stream and seeing
what is available.

### Share

You can share a command you have access to, if you have enough Cool Points.

```bash
!share !clap @artmattdank
```

This essentially duplicates ownership of the command with the other viewer.

### Steal

You can steal a command from someone else as well, and they will lose access
